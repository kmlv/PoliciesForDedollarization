% The first group represent the role of buyers; and the second represent the role of sellers. %KL did not understand this.

% Participants are randomly matched following a known distribution. 
% The matching probabilities are determined by the technology described in $(1)$, and varies with the trade integration degree, $\rho$. 
% If both parts match, buyers and sellers must decide, privately and simultaneously, whether to make the exchange. After that, the answers are revealed and the exchange occurs only if there is a mutual agreement.

% However, the theory being tested is almost always an infinite horizon model.  The actual experimental design has, by necessity, some infinite truncation of the original model. 
% **While the literature has employed probabilistic stopping rules to mitigate the problem, that does not solve the issue:  the models that have been tested do not have any monetary equilibria. **
% One might argue that it is interesting to see if monetary exchange emerges in the lab when theory says monetary equilibrium does not exist.  However, that seems like a disingenuous motivation, and is certainly not the way these papers are typically written.  It seems clear that the writers were more interested in checking if monetary exchange emerges in the lab when theory says that a monetary equilibrium exists. Therefore, the fact that it does not eximst in the games being implemented is problematic.  
% Our contribution is to point out that there are simple finite horizon models in which monetary exchange can emerge as an equilibrium outcome.  Therefore, we are able to test in the lab what happens when at money is introduced in treatments where, according to theory, money can be valued as an equilibrium outcome, and also compare with treatments where money theoretically should have no effect. The results of our experiments are puzzling, with money being more useful in the settings where theory says there is no monetary equilibrium.  An avenue for future research is to identify what is driving individuals to use money in lab experiments, if  not  standard  notions  of  monetary  equilibrium.   And,  of  course,  such  research should include experiments in settings that actually have a monetary equilibrium.
